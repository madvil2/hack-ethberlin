# Cr3dential - HackETHBerlin Submission

## Project Overview

**Cr3dential** addresses inefficient academic credential verification, data privacy concerns, and cumbersome academic record management for students. Using zero-knowledge proof (zk proof) technology, it ensures secure, instant verification without exposing personal data. Cr3dential provides a streamlined platform for managing and sharing academic achievements, enhancing trust and efficiency for both students and institutions.

## Key Features

- **Secure Verification**: Employs zero-knowledge proofs (zk proof) to verify credentials without revealing personal data.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensures that student data remains private and secure during the verification process.
- **Efficiency**: Simplifies the management and sharing of academic achievements.
- **Trust**: Enhances trust between students and institutions through verifiable credentials.

## Challenges We Faced

- Obtaining verifiable credentials from educational institutions.
- Implementing zero-knowledge proof technology effectively.
